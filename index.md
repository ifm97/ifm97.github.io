The **R** **E**pidemics **Con**sortium (RECON) is international
not-for-profit, **non-governmental organisation** gathering experts in data
science, modelling methodology, public health, and software development to
create the next generation of analytics tools for informing the response
to *disease outbreaks*, *health emergencies* and *humanitarian crises*, 
using the [R software](https://www.r-project.org/) and other free, 
open-source resources.

This includes packages specifically designed for handling, visualising, and
analysing outbreak data using cutting-edge statistical methods, as well as more
general-purpose tools for data cleaning, versioning, and encryption, and system
infrastructure.

Our packages must fulfil three key aspects:

- *Efficiency*: our tools can be used in real time to improve situation
  awareness and inform intervention strategies.

- *Reliability*: our tools are thoroughly and constantly tested using
  professional software development methods.

- *Accessibility*: our tools are free, open-source, and available on virtually
  any platform; they can be used with different levels of expertise, and provide
  graphical user interfaces implementing the most important functionalities.

Besides its active involvement in the creation of tools, RECON is also
increasingly dedicated to:

- *disseminating knowledge*: RECON is developing a new training platform, and a
   series of workshops and short courses on epidemics analysis and outbreak
   response. Our [public forum ](/forum) is also dedicated to sharing exptertise
   on these topics.

- *outbreak response deployment*: RECON supports the deployment of data analysts
   to the field as part of outbreak response teams; this includes the deployment
   of staff as well as analysis systems adapted to low resources settings.
